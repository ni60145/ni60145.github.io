# Dangerous Woman Album 
### by Ariana Grande

You can listen to the [Dangerous Woman Album](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_nVnvW2WNXgkuDNaMYBOW3qm-1BX7Hira8) and enjoy her music!

This is my favorite song in the album. I think it's the best and the most underrated song in the album. As of February 22, 2022, it only has 964,269 views.
