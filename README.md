# Ariana Grande Albums

I have been a fan of Ariana Grande since I don't know when. She is one of my favorite female artists out there and her songs are always a bop. I listen to her songs every day. I wish that she would have a concert here in the Philippines after the pandemic. She is currently taking a break from making music but I hope she would continue to make more music and I hope she wouldn't end up like Rihanna. Anyway, here are some of her albums and my favorite songs from her albums;


## Yours Truly

**'ghostin'** is my favorite song in this album. In this song, she's saying a thank you to pete davidson for his understanding of mac's passing. If you didn't know already, ariana had to break off her engagement with pete because she still loved mac, her ex boyfriend who she still had love for, but he passed. She is saying she knows it breaks his heart when she cries again over mac. but she is also saying that she can't get over mac, therefore she and pete needed to break up, because she knew her truest love was gone. As of February 22, 2022, it has 31 million views.

#### Mrs. Ariana Grande started her music career at the age of 15 on 2008. She has come a long way from then to now. She has inspired many and is still continuing to today. I hope that she will be rested to make music again in the future.
